I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
When I open the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. Then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
When I view the time blocks for that day Then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When I click into a time block Then I can enter an event When I click the save button for that time block Then the text for that event is saved in local storage When I refresh the page Then the saved events persist.
